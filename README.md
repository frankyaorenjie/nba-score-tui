## macOS Menubar App

This repo now also includes a native macOS menubar app under [`macos-menubar`](./macos-menubar) that uses the same live NBA scoreboard feed as the TUI.

Requirements:
- macOS 13+
- Xcode Command Line Tools / Swift 6

Run it directly from the repo:

```bash
npm run menubar
# or
swift run --package-path macos-menubar NBAScoreMenubar
```

Build the Swift package:

```bash
npm run menubar:build
```

Build a standalone `.app` bundle in `dist/NBAScoreMenubar-<arch>.app`:

```bash
npm run menubar:bundle
```

The menubar app:
- Polls the official NBA live scoreboard every 20 seconds
- Shows today's games in a native `MenuBarExtra` window
- Lets you star games to pin them to the menu bar
- Rotates through starred games in the menu bar every 6 seconds, or all games when none are starred
- Uses a simpler list-based window and menu layout
- Opens the full NBA.com scoreboard from the menu
